/**
 * The surface set is **derived**, and an unclassified producer is red.
 *
 * This is the file [§ D163](../../../../DECISIONS.md)'s *"derive the surface set, do not list
 * it"* lives in. It computes the set of player-facing text producers from the source tree and
 * partitions it into two, exhaustively:
 *
 * - **driven** — named in some `SURFACE_ADAPTERS` entry's `covers`, and therefore rendered on
 *   every case of every campaign;
 * - **excluded** — named in {@link NOT_PLAYER_FACING} with a reason.
 *
 * Anything in neither fails this test. So a new text producer is unchecked → red, which is the
 * clause the decision spells out: *"a hand-written parity list … would fail the same way —
 * silently, when a ninth failure state is added."*
 *
 * Three further guards keep the partition from rotting in the other direction:
 *
 * 1. **No stale coverage.** An adapter may not claim a declaration the derivation does not find —
 *    a `covers` entry for a renamed export is a claim about nothing.
 * 2. **No stale exclusion.** An exclusion for a declaration that no longer exists is deleted, not
 *    kept "just in case": a list of ghosts is how a list stops being read.
 * 3. **No overlap.** A declaration may not be both driven and excluded.
