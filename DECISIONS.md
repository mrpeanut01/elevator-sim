# Decision log

Decisions made during orchestrated delivery, with the alternatives considered. Project-technical
decisions that belong to a doc are recorded there as well, per
[`CLAUDE.md` § Working agreements](CLAUDE.md).

## D1 — Work the review register before any tuning or measurement campaign

**Date:** 2026-07-27 · **Owner:** orchestrator

**Context.** [`docs/08-review-findings.md`](docs/08-review-findings.md) carries 21 open findings.
Three of them (#9/#10 predictor horizon, #12/#13 late-arrival reopen, #21 overload threshold) are
declared Phase 7 search dimensions that provably cannot move any objective, and one (#14) means
every published interval past n=25 uses the normal quantile while being labelled paired-t.

**Alternatives.** (a) Start Phase 6/8 immediately and fix findings opportunistically.
(b) Fix the register first. (c) Fix only the critical finding.

**Chosen:** (b). **Why:** a tuning campaign run against the current tree spends 50–200 replications
per evaluation on at least three exactly-flat dimensions and reports whichever value the draw held
as a tuned result — and every interval it publishes is anticonservative. Fixing afterwards means
re-running the campaign. `docs/07-handoff.md` states this ordering explicitly.

**Impact.** Wave 1 is register work plus the Phase 7 seam. Phases 6 and 8 move to waves 3 and 4.

## D2 — Phase 4 (visualization) runs in parallel with wave 1, not after it

**Date:** 2026-07-27 · **Owner:** orchestrator

**Context.** Phase 4 creates a new `packages/viz` and consumes `core`'s public API. The roadmap's
sequencing notes say Phase 4 can run in parallel once Phase 2 is complete; Phase 2 landed.

**Alternatives.** (a) Serialize after the register. (b) Parallelize now.

**Chosen:** (b), scoped to a foundation task (T5) rather than a fan-out. **Why:** the file set is
disjoint from every other wave-1 task (a new package plus three root config files), so it carries
no merge risk, and it is the longest-lead item with a UX cycle attached. Fanning out UI features
before the contract is locked is exactly what the plan's planning-first rule forbids, so T5
delivers the contract and skeleton and wave 2 fans out against it.

**Impact.** `tsconfig.json`, root `package.json` and `vitest.config.ts` are owned by T5 for wave 1.

## D3 — `sim/simulation.ts` has a single named owner per wave

**Date:** 2026-07-27 · **Owner:** orchestrator

**Context.** The roadmap records that Phase 5 shipped four dead seams simultaneously because work
was partitioned by module directory and `sim/simulation.ts` appeared in no agent's ownership list.

**Alternatives.** (a) Let any task edit it and resolve conflicts at merge. (b) Assign it to one
task per wave. (c) Orchestrator owns it and applies wiring edits itself.

**Chosen:** (b) — T3 owns it for wave 1. **Why:** (a) reproduces the documented root cause; (c)
puts the orchestrator in the critical path of every task. Naming an owner makes the seam somebody's
definition of done, which is the fix the roadmap asks for.

**Impact.** T1, T2, T4 and T5 may not write `sim/simulation.ts`. Any wiring they need is requested
from T3.

## D4 — Worktrees get a `node_modules` symlink rather than their own install

**Date:** 2026-07-27 · **Owner:** orchestrator

**Context.** Concurrent tasks run in git worktrees, which have no `node_modules`. The repo is an
npm workspace whose `vitest.config.ts` aliases cross-package specifiers to package *source*, and
`packages/*/node_modules` hold nothing but a `.vite` cache.

**Alternatives.** (a) `npm install` per worktree. (b) Symlink the root `node_modules`.

**Chosen:** (b). **Why:** the alias config means no worktree needs a built `dist` of a sibling
package to run tests, so a shared dependency tree is sufficient and avoids five redundant installs.

**Impact.** Any task that needs to run the *built* CLI (`node packages/cli/dist/index.js`) must run
`npx tsc -b` in its own worktree first; `dist/` is gitignored so it will not conflict at merge.
